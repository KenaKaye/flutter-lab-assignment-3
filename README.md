$AlbumFetch

AlbumFetch is a Flutter application that fetches and displays album titles and photos from the JSONPlaceholder API. The app features a scrollable list of albums, with each item navigable to a detail screen showing the albumâ€™s photos. Built with the MVVM architecture, it uses http for networking, flutter_bloc for state management, and go_router for navigation. The UI is styled with a sleek black and golden theme, includes robust error handling for network failures, and supports navigation via an AppBar back button, a floating back button, and the Android back gesture.
